Model: Twitter-RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis Model
Model Description:
The Twitter-RoBERTa sentiment analysis model is a pre-trained natural language processing model based on the RoBERTa architecture. It has been specifically trained on a large corpus of Twitter data to perform sentiment analysis on short text inputs, such as tweets. The model is fine-tuned to classify text into three sentiment categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive.

Model Usage:
The model accepts an input text and predicts the sentiment label and score for the given text. The sentiment label indicates the predicted sentiment category (Negative, Neutral, or Positive), while the score represents the confidence or probability of the predicted sentiment label.

Endpoint:
The model is exposed through the following API endpoint:
- POST /sentiment: Analyzes the sentiment of an input text and returns the predicted sentiment label and score.

Request Format:
The API expects a JSON payload with the following format:
{
    "text": "Input text to analyze sentiment"
}

Response Format:
The API response is a JSON object with the following format:
{
    "text": "Input text",
    "sentiment": "Predicted sentiment label",
    "score": "Sentiment score"
}

Dependencies:
The model requires the following dependencies:
- Flask: A lightweight web framework used to build the API endpoints.
- Transformers: A library that provides access to pre-trained NLP models and tokenization functionality.

Pre-trained Model Details:
The model is based on the "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest" pre-trained checkpoint. It has been fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques on a large collection of Twitter data annotated with sentiment labels.
